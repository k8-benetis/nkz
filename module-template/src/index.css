/* Module Template - Custom Styles
   ============================================================================
   
   IMPORTANT: Do NOT include @tailwind directives (@tailwind base, components, 
   utilities) in module CSS files!
   
   The host application already includes Tailwind CSS. Including them here 
   would reset global styles and break the host's layout, sidebar, and 
   overall page structure.
   
   Instead, use scoped class names for your module-specific styles, or 
   rely on Tailwind utility classes in your JSX components.
